        Polar bears are my favorite animal.

        In elementary school, I was in a photography class and we were told to bring our favorite thing to share with the class and keep it in a capsule at school.
        I brought my most prized possession, my polar bear beanie baby.

        At the end of the semester, I forgot to bring home my beanie baby from school and by the time I remembered, the school had already thrown it away. LOL.
